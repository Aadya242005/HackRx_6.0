Some of the contents shown in policy wordings might be applicable for certain Sections and not generic, e.g. some
contents are useful for “Trip Delay” cover only. The Company intends to use the contents dynamically based on the
coverage offered to the Policyholder/Insured; e.g. If the Insured Person doesn’t opt for “Trip Delay”
overage offered to the Policyholder/Insured; e.g. If the Insured Person doesn’t opt for “Trip Delay”, then wording,
terms and conditions related to this Specific Section will not be shown on the Policy Wordings. Similarly, general
exclusions or general conditions which might not be applicable for Sections chosen by Policyholder/Insured will not
be shown. Idea of doing this is to make policy wording more apt and concise to customer need and provide relevant
